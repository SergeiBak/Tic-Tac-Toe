## Overview
This project is a recreation of Tic Tac Toe, a game whose first print reference is sourced back to 1884! A fun fact is that three-in-a-row board games can be traced back to ancient Egypt as early as 1300 BC. This solo project was developed in Unity using C# as part of my minigames series where I utilize various resources to remake simple games in order to further my learning as well as to have fun!   

In Tic Tac Toe, one player represents X, and the other represents O. Each player takes turns marking a empty spot on the 3x3 board until one wins by marking 3 boxes in a row with their symbol (Horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or until the board is out of space resulting in a draw.     

## Test The Project!
In order to play this version of Tic Tac Toe, follow the [link](https://sergeibak.github.io/PersonalWebsite/TicTacToe.html) to a in-browser WebGL build (No download required!).

## Code
A brief description of all of the classes is as follows:
- The `Board` class handles the marking of slots on the board, as well as tracking the game state.
- The `Box` class handles the structure/status of each slot on the board.
- The `Mark` class is a enum declaration of the various states of a slot (None, X, O).
- The `WinUI` class handles the UI that is displayed upon the completion of a game.
